.. Complete documentation for the schema

Schema Documentation
====================

This document contains the complete specification for the ChemKED schema. The schema is broken into
several files for ease of maintenance. These files are combined with the custom ``!include``
directive that has been added for this purpose. Note that ``!include`` should only be used in the
main schema file (``chemked_schema.yaml``) and must appear at the top of the file. The ``!include``
directive is **not** supported in any actual ChemKED files.

Examples of constructing a ChemKED format file, as well as examples of files themselves, are located
in :doc:`ck-tutorial`. The sections laid out in this file roughly correspond to the sections
discussed in the tutorial.

.. _schema-only-keys:

Schema-Only Keys
----------------

The schema files contain several keys that are used purely as references within the schema and
should not be used in actual ChemKED files. These keys are documented in this section.

.. _schema-author:

    - ``name``: string, required
        The author's full name

.. _schema-value-with-uncertainty:

* ``value-with-uncertainty``: sequence
    A combination of a value and unit with uncertainty. Sequence elements:

    - 0: string, required
        The first element of the sequence should be the value and its associated
        units. The units are validated to have appropriate dimensions for the particular quantity
        under consideration

    - 1: mapping, optional
        The second element of the sequence should be a mapping representing the uncertainty. Fields:

        * ``uncertainty-type``: string, required
            The type of uncertainty. Options are ``absolute`` or ``relative``.

        * ``uncertainty``: string, required, excludes ``upper-uncertainty`` and ``lower-uncertainty``
            The value of the uncertainty. If ``uncertainty-type`` is ``absolute``, must include
            units whose dimensions match the units of the value in the first element of the
            sequence.

        * ``upper-uncertainty``: string, required, excludes ``uncertainty``, requires ``lower-uncertainty``
            The upper value of an asymmetrical uncertainty. Due to limitations in the Python
            library, asymmetrical uncertainties aren't supported in PyKED, so the larger of
            ``upper-uncertainty`` and ``lower-uncertainty`` is used.

        * ``lower-uncertainty``: string, required, excludes ``uncertainty``, requires ``upper-uncertainty``
            The lower value of an asymmetrical uncertainty. Due to limitations in the Python
            library, asymmetrical uncertainties aren't supported in PyKED, so the larger of
            ``upper-uncertainty`` and ``lower-uncertainty`` is used.

.. _schema-value-without-uncertainty:

* ``value-without-uncertainty``: sequence
    A combination of a value and unit without uncertainty. Sequence elements:

    - 0: string, required
        The first element of the sequence should be the value and its associated
        units. The units are validated to have appropriate dimensions for the particular quantity
        under consideration

.. _schema-value-unit-required:

* ``value-unit-required``: sequence, required
    A sequence conforming to either :ref:`value-with-uncertainty <schema-value-with-uncertainty>` or
    :ref:`value-without-uncertainty <schema-value-without-uncertainty>`. Must be included in the
    ChemKED file.

.. _schema-value-unit-optional:

* ``value-unit-optional``: sequence, optional
    A sequence conforming to either :ref:`value-with-uncertainty <schema-value-with-uncertainty>` or
    :ref:`value-without-uncertainty <schema-value-without-uncertainty>`. May or may not be included
    in the ChemKED file.
